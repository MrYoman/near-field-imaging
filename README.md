## Overview

We propose an unsupervised method that introduces the _XiEff_ representation â€“ a neural field-based parameterization of the effective susceptibility. By integrating _XiEff_ into the Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation for near-field optics, we develop an optimization strategy to reconstruct the effective susceptibility distribution directly from NFI data.
